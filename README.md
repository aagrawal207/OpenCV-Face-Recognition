# OpenCV-Face-Recognition

We are working on a project which should take the picture/pictures of a classroom and mark the attendance of all the students present in the class. We are trying to use dlib and OpenCV libraries for face detection and OpenCV for face recognition(createLBPHFaceRecognizer() to be exact). We also tried OpenFace but were not able to set it up, we will again try it later. We are also experimenting with the Cognitive API of Microsoft for face recognition.

Face detection is near perfect and we mainly need to work on improving face recognition.

Exact statistics for the accuracy of the system will we updated soon.

For more information, also refer to steps_for_face_recognition.txt. Feedback and Suggestions will be really appreciated.
